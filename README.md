University of Waterloo iOS Application

I realized that most tech schools have a decent looking mobile application for their students, however, UW has nothing of the sort. So this project is to bring UW to the next level in the frontier of technology.

There are a lot of plans for this app and it will include everything from school to social media.

Open source was the best choice for this project because I will not be at UW forever, so it is up to the community to keep the app up to date when it is complete.

I will be uploading a design plan soon so that other people will have an idea of the direction this project will be going.
